      question: "What are crowns made from?",
      answer: "Crowns, or caps as they are sometimes known, are porcelain/metal or composite covers for damaged or unsightly teeth. They can be made from gold, porcelain or a combination of both, and more recently ceramic. Ceramic crowns are carefully crafted to look more natural and blend in with the rest of your teeth and can eliminate dark metallic lines around the gums."
    },
    {
      question: "What is a bridge?",
      answer: "Bridges work by filling (or bridging) the gap created by one or more missing teeth, and are made up of two or more crowns on either side of the gap. They work and feel like real teeth."
    },
    {
      question: "How long do dental bridges last?",
      answer: "A dental bridge is designed to last for many years, so it's important to look after the bridge in the same way as natural teeth, by sticking to a good daily oral routine and attending regular hygiene visits."
    },
    {
      question: "What if one of my crowns has fallen off or is loose?",
      answer: "Keep your crown safe so it can be re-cemented as soon as possible to avoid damage. If it is loose â€“ the same advice applies. Please contact us immediately."

              Treatment for restoring you mouth's function includes crowns (or caps) that are carefully crafted to look natural and blend in with the rest of your teeth. Crowns can be used to strengthen teeth that have been weakened by decay or a large filling; to protect fractured, cracked and worn teeth; to improve the shape, alignment and shade of a tooth and to help strengthen the tooth after root canal treatment.

            <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed text-lg">
              Bridges can be used to permanently fit a replacement tooth or teeth by being carefully attached to adjacent teeth and replace missing ones.
