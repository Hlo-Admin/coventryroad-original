                Coventry Road Dental Care offers a range of finance options to
                allow you to get the treatment your dentist has recommended
                whilst letting you spread the cost over a time that suits you.

                Can It Be Used for Any Treatment?
              </h2>
              <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                It is particularly useful for cosmetic dentistry, orthodontic
                work and implants. You can borrow any amount over Â£750 upwards,
                subject to status. You need to be over 18 to apply, and you must
                have lived in the UK for at least 3 years.
              </p>

                How Much Are the Repayments?
              </h2>
              <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                Obviously this will depend on the amount you borrow, the
                interest rate and the term of the loan. The staff at the
                practice will show you, completely without obligation, the
                schemes the practice has available for you to pay for your
                treatment.
              </p>

                Do I Have To Pay a Deposit?
              </h2>
              <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                A deposit is not required, but if you want to pay one and so
                reduce the amount you borrow, this is completely up to you.
              </p>

              <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-[#6a3870] mt-8 mb-4">
                How Do I Apply?
              </h2>
              <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                The practice staff will complete a simple, online application
                process with you. This will only take a few minutes. The
                information is transmitted to the lender immediately and a reply
                is usually received by return. You can then either sign a credit
                agreement that the practice print for you, or have it emailed
                for you to complete at home.
              </p>

                When Can I Start the Treatment?
              </h2>
              <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                An appointment can be arranged as soon as the credit agreement
                has been signed.
              </p>

              <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-[#6a3870] mt-8 mb-4">
                How Do I Make Repayments?
              </h2>
              <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                Repayments are made by monthly direct debit, starting one month
                after you sign the credit agreement.
              </p>

              <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-[#6a3870] mt-8 mb-4">
                What if I Decide That I Don't Want the Finance?
              </h2>
              <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                There is a statutory 'cooling off' period of 14 days after
                signature during which you can cancel the credit agreement with
                no cost to you. However, if you have started any treatment which
                would have been financed, you will have to make other
                arrangements to pay for it.
